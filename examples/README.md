## Examples

Ready-to-run projects showing different testing workflows

Each example is a **minimal React Native + Storybook app** with:

- Sherlo integration
- GitHub Actions workflow

### 📦 Standard

Full app builds with bundled JavaScript code – traditional approach for any React Native project

[View example →](./standard)

### ⚡ EAS Update

Skip rebuilds for JavaScript changes – use Over-The-Air updates to test faster

[View example →](./eas-update)

### ☁️ EAS Cloud Build

Trigger visual tests automatically when Expo finishes building your app
