# Examples

These examples show you how to set up visual testing for React Native Storybook using different methods. Each example is a complete, working project you can clone and run.

---

## 📁 Available Examples

| Example | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [**standard**](./standard) | Test builds with bundled JavaScript code stored locally |
| [**eas-update**](./eas-update) | Test builds with OTA updates via EAS Update |
| [**eas-cloud-build**](./eas-cloud-build) | Test cloud builds created on Expo servers automatically |

---

## 🎯 Choosing the Right Method

**Start with standard** if you're new to Sherlo or want the simplest setup.

**Switch to eas-update** when you're tired of rebuilding after every JS change. You'll only rebuild when native code changes.

**Use eas-cloud-build** when you want to eliminate local builds entirely and automatically test every cloud build from Expo.
