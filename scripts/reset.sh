# Performs a complete clean and rebuild of the entire monorepo.

#   1. Removes all node_modules and dist directories
#   2. Clears yarn cache
#   3. Reinstalls all dependencies
#   4. Builds all packages (CLI + react-native-storybook)
#   5. Installs dependencies for testing projects
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/reset.sh
