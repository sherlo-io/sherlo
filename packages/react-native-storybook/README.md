# @sherlo/react-native-storybook

This package is a critical component of the Visual Testing solution provided by Sherlo, designed for projects
with [Storybook React Native](https://github.com/storybookjs/react-native) integration. It allows selective visibility
between your app and Storybook within Sherlo's infrastructure emulators or when manually toggled via the React Native
development menu.

## Features

- **Toggle Visibility**: Allows toggling between the app and Storybook via the React Native dev menu. The selected state
  persists across app refreshes.

- **Control and Monitor Storybook**: Enables Sherlo to control which stories are rendered, monitor app state,
  communicate with the test runner, and capture screenshots during visual testing.

## Installation

Visit the [Sherlo Docs website](https://docs.sherlo.io/getting-started/setup) to learn how to connect it to your
project.
